> What are dependency constraints?

Dependency constraints are used to add constraints on the transitive dependencies. They only take effect if there are actually that transitive dependencies.

Read [Upgrading versions of transitive dependencies](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_constraints.html) to see more details.
